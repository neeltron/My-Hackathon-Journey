        <p>Isn't the title hectic enough? Yes, I did (or at least tried to do four hackathons on the same weekend), out of which 2 didn't allow cross-submissions. For PetPal, it took me 6 hours after submission to realize that the audio wasn't recorded ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br>Conclusion: Don't participate in 4 hackathons at once, unless they're allowing cross submissions.<br><a href="https://devpost.com/software/pridenet">Pride Hacks + DefHacks</a><br><a href = "https://devpost.com/software/petpal-wk2bzg">R.
